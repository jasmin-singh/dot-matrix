# dot-matrix
A Python3/Python Turtle program that takes raster image data values from any image and renders the image in black-and-white, pseudocolor, and grayscale dot matrix.

# How does it work?

# Purpose and applications
I made this as an experimental tool to render important image information with the least amount of detail. It's fascinating to see what information our eyes and brain need to understand what an image is trying to convey. 
The grayscale mode reveals the depth of the image. Seeing an image in pseudocolor can help with understanding lighting, especially within low-light images (think of a heat signature). Black-and-white rendering can help with identifying silhouettes. Different rendering sizes help with interpreting how much detail is needed to see information in an image. <br />

This is also important to learn when creating art. I aim to improve this program to become a tool (a helping eye) for artists — since it reduces the image to barebones information, this program can help artists understand what information is important when they look at reference images.
