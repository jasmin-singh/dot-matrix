# dot-matrix
A Python3/Python Turtle program that takes raster image data values from any image and renders the image in black-and-white, pseudocolor, and grayscale dot matrix.

I made this as an experimental tool to render important image information with the least amount of detail possible. It's fascinating to see what information our eyes and brain need to understand what an image is trying to convey. This is also important to learn when creating art, so I aim to improve this program to become a helpful tool (a helping eye) for artists â€” since it reduces the image to barebones information, this program can help artists understand what information is important when they look at reference images.
